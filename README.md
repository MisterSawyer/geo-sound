# Geo-Sound

<https://arcast.site/geo-sound/>

A Flask-based web application for uploading, managing, and exploring MP3 tracks on an interactive map.
Each track has metadata (title, owner, latitude, longitude) and is displayed both in a list and as a Leaflet marker on the map.

## âœ¨ Features

* Upload MP3 files with metadata (title, owner, lat/lon)

* Display all tracks in a list with embedded audio players

* Interactive map (Leaflet) showing tracks by geographic location

* Delete tracks (removes both .mp3 and .json metadata)
